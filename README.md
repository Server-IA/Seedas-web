# SEEDAS

## Sustainable Rural Transportation P2P Platform

SEEDAS is a responsive full-stack web platform that connects rural producers with rural transporters through a collaborative economy model. It enables the publication of vehicles, transportation needs, and community routes, facilitating the logistical management of agricultural and livestock cargo in rural contexts.

The project was created to address the lack of transportation options adapted to specific cargo types and tertiary rural roads, using a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach, a modern cloud-based architecture, and a modular and scalable system.
